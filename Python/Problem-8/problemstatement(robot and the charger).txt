There is a robot which wants to go the charging point to charge itself. The robot moves in a 2-D plane from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 Then, the output of the program should be: 2 The numbers after the direction are steps. Write a program to compute the distance between the current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer (use round() function for that and then convert it into an integer). Input Format: The first line of the input contains a number n which implies the number of directions to be given. The next n lines contain the direction and the step separated by a space. Output Format: Print the distance from the original position to the current position. Example: Input: 4 UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 Output: 2 Explanation: After the movements, the robot is at the position (-1, 2). Distance from the (0, 0) to the point (-1, 2) is calculated as The round value of which is 2.0, and int value is 2. NOTE: Import math library and use the sqrt() function of the math library to compute the distance. Guide to calculate the distance from the point (a,b) to (c,d) is here Guide to use math sqrt function is here.
