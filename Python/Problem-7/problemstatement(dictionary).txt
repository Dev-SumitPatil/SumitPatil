You have seen in the videos that how powerful dictionary data structure is.
In this assignment, given a number n, you have to write a program that generates a dictionary d which contains (i, i*i), where i is from 1 to n (both included).
Then you have to just print this dictionary d.
Example:
Input: 4
will give output as
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
Input Format:
Take the number n in a single line.
Output Format:
Print the dictionary d in a single line.
Example:
Input:
8
Output:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
Explanation:
Here n is 8, we will start from i=1, hence the first element of the dictionary is (1: 1), as i becomes 2, the second element of the dictionary becomes (2: 4) and so on.
Hence the output will be {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}.
